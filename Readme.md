## Overview
The goal of the final project is to give you a chance to explore and apply an advanced algorithm to a real world problem. Advanced algorithm analysis forms much of the theoretical foundation of computer science.  Rather than give a final exam, we would rather see you use your analytical and critical thinking abilities expressed towards accomplishing a goal of a producing a software product that implements something you are interested in. This document will outline the minimum basic expectations for the project and how you should implement and deliver that project, but you are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond the minimum expectations. Work that goes above and beyond may earn extra credit.
