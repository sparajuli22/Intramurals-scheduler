# Algorithm Final Project - Intramurals Scheduling using Bipartite Algorithm

## Purpose and goals:
1. Utilize the knowledge that we learn from CS 473
2. Solve real world occuring problems
3. Provides programming utility and efficiency towards the client (Todd Sandberg)
4. Create an executable files that can be accessed by the client
5. Analyze the data and give the most optimal schedule through bipartite matching
6. Recreate the Bipartite matching algorithm (Modified to match our needs and goals)
7. Make sure the program works for every cases including:
   1. Any amount of sports
   2. Any given days
   3. Any amount of teams

## Running the program
For now:
1. Make sure that Python are installed in the device
2. Install some extensions (Panda, Numpy, Xlsx)
3. Copy the csv path to the data
4. Run the program by clicking run
5. 35 different excel files should be generated by now
6. 35 files are earned through 7 days X 5 different sports

## Assumption:
* We are assuming that the U-Rec have some experience with working with executable files
* Through my experience (Michael) with working with the U-rec, The U-Rec has some software training such as fusion software that are more complex. This executable file would be easily implemented by U-Rec
* Program assumption:
    1. We assume that the name of each time are unique
    2. U-Rec will not change the way they gather all the data (Qualdratics Survey)
    3. Each team needs to have game at least 1-2x
    4. This is only generated for regular season (excluding playoffs)
## Functions:
1. Check: returning a (n)^2 2Dimensional list where n is the number of teams
2. common: Finding common time between 2 teams through boolean (pairing compatibilty [True/False])
3. filter: Returning a list of size (number of team) that is set to -1 as default
4. findpossiblematch: Checking the pairing compatibility of each teams and change the value of -1 to the index of the team that each team is playing against
5. common_time : After finding the compatible pairings and it has been stabilized, then common time between two teams will be determined
6. Others:
    * Reading and Printing the data to excel sheet
    * Panda commands

## Accomplishment:
We have contacted the U-Rec and they agreed to use this program next semester. It will help the efficiency of creating a stable schedule.
